Problem 2: 
Write a program in javascript to find pairs of positive integers (A,B) whose sum is equal to the input number N (N < 10 power 6).
Link to test data (json) : https://api.myjson.com/bins/15hs37
						
The conditions to be satisfied by A & B are:
●  A has at least two digits and starts with a non-zero digit
●  B always has one digit less than A
●  B can start with 0
●  B is obtained from A by leaving out one digit.
								
The output should also indicate the number of such pairs.
For example, if we input 1002 to the program, the output should be as follows: 4 pairs found:
906 + 96 = 1002
911 + 91 = 1002
951 + 51 = 1002
1001 + 001 = 1002
								
Assuming input is provided in testdata.in with the following contents: 2
								
1002 11
								
Line 1:
Number of test cases
							
Line 2 Onwards:
The Number itself
Print the output in the following format. TEST #1
4 pairs found
906 + 96 = 1002
911 + 91 = 1002
951 + 51 = 1002
TEST #2
1 pair found 10 + 1 = 11
